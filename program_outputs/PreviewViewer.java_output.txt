The ScrollPane class in JavaFX is a control that provides a scrolled and clipped viewport of its contents. It allows users to scroll the content either by panning or using scroll bars. The ScrollPane allows for customization of the scroll bar policy, which determines when the scroll bars are displayed. It also allows for setting the current, minimum, and maximum values for positioning the contents in the horizontal and vertical directions. The layout calculations of the ScrollPane are based on the layoutBounds of the scroll node, rather than the boundsInParent. The ScrollPane class sets focusTraversable to false.
